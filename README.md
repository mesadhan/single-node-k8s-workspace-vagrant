# MicroK8s Single Node Playground - Lightweight upstream K8s

The smallest, simplest, pure production K8s. For clusters, laptops, IoT, and Edge, on Intel and ARM. I found it an alternative of minikube. 
When you are familiar with the single node cluster when It's handy for you to setup Cluster with micorK8s. I explore it on IoT devices. If you are really interested in setup IoT cluster then definitely checkout on raspberry pi. I explore different Dev. packages like Nginx, MongoDB. On the other hand tries to cover Kubernetes' common concepts like CLI commands, dashboard, service, pods, container, registry, routes, networking, load balancing, scaling,  deployment configuration, etc.
